This is best served sooner than later as the avocado color will fade, but it has a few hours of holding power.", "author": "Martha Rose Shulman", "image": [{"@id": "nyt://image/5a62f402-5a58-573d-b0f4-19cec92140b0#videoSixteenByNine1050", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "creditText": "Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times", "dateModified": "2014-04-14T14:36:49.000Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "height": "591", "representativeOfPage": true, "uploadDate": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "width": "1050"}, {"@id": "nyt://image/5a62f402-5a58-573d-b0f4-19cec92140b0#superJumbo", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-superJumbo.jpg", "creditText": "Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times", "dateModified": "2014-04-14T14:36:49.000Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "height": "1365", "representativeOfPage": true, "uploadDate": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-superJumbo.jpg", "width": "2048"}, {"@id": "nyt://image/5a62f402-5a58-573d-b0f4-19cec92140b0#square640", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-square640.jpg", "creditText": "Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times", "dateModified": "2014-04-14T14:36:49.000Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "height": "640", "representativeOfPage": true, "uploadDate": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-square640.jpg", "width": "640"}], "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "indian, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, appetizer", "keywords": "avocado, cilantro, cumin seed, guacamole, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": 5, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "169 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe Hass avocados, halved and pitted", "1 small tomato, chopped", "1 small red onion, finely diced", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "1 jalape\u00f1o, minced (seeded for a milder flavor)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds, ground if desired", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground peppercorns", "Juice of 2 limes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut avocados into small dice.

Here Are 5 Easy Substitutes.", "No Cracking Required: Here Are 5 Substitutes for Eggs"], "alternativeHeadline": ["Egg Prices Are (Still) Up. Here Are 5 Easy Substitutes.", "No Cracking Required: Here Are 5 Substitutes for Eggs"], "articleBody": "Let\u2019s be honest: There is no perfect substitute for eggs.\nThat may be why their steady rise in price not only hurts in the budget, but also somewhere in the soul. The crackly, golden wisps around the edges of a fried egg? The golden orb of yolk in a jammy boiled egg? Irreplaceable and often worth the splurge.\nBut when eggs are used as an ingredient, they can, at times, be swapped out, something that\u2019s necessary for those with allergies or other dietary restrictions, and preferable for others.\nTo swap effectively is to understand the many ways eggs work in recipes. For starters, they moisten dishes with their water content and make them richer with their fatty yolks. When the whites are heated or mixed with acid, their proteins coagulate and the whites solidify, adding structure and acting as a glue that binds ingredients. When beaten, whites also trap and hold a lot of air. Yolks and whole eggs can do this, too \u2014 not quite as well as whites alone, but enough that they lift baked goods and add fluffiness to savory dishes.\nBecause cooking and especially baking are made up of a series of chemical reactions, the most foolproof eggless recipes were intentionally created without eggs. But Genevieve Meli, an associate professor of baking and pastry arts at the Culinary Institute of America, thinks most desserts can be made eggless with some trial and error. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d stay away from are confections like nougat,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s pure chemistry.\u201d\nIf you do want to try making an eggy recipe eggless, experiment with the substitutions below, ordered by most to least versatile:\nEgg Substitutes for Baking and Sweets\n1. Flax gel\n\nHow to Sub: For each large egg, which weighs about 50 grams, mix 7 grams (1 tablespoon) flax meal with 43 grams (3 tablespoons) water and let sit until thickened like gel, 5 to 10 minutes.\nWhat It Can Do: Bind ingredients and add structure, moisture and fat.\nWhere to Use It: Cookies, bars, denser cakes, cupcakes, muffins, yeast rolls\nFlax \u201ceggs\u201d are the most versatile substitute because flax contains fat, has a subtle nutty taste that pairs with just about any sweet and binds ingredients together well. Ms. Meli, who recently wrote \u201cBaking an Impact: Small Changes for More Sustainable Baking,\u201d recommends starting with whole flaxseeds and grinding them yourself in a spice grinder because the fat in flax makes preground meal go rancid quickly. She also says that, for most baked goods, whole chia seeds can be used in the same way in the same proportions. Both substitutes would benefit from adding a pinch more of baking powder to the mix.\n2. Aquafaba\n\nHow to Sub: Drain a can of chickpeas in a strainer set over a bowl. That cloudy elixir is aquafaba. It should be as viscous as an egg white; if it isn\u2019t, simmer it to thicken. For one whole egg, use 57 grams (\u00bc cup) and for one egg white, use 29 grams (2 tablespoons).\nWhat It Can Do: Add moisture and, if beaten to peaks, provide lift.\nWhere to Use It: Meringues; Pavlova; sheet cakes; brownies; yeast breads; pancakes\nIt\u2019s a cloudy miracle, the way this bean liquid can be whisked into stiff white peaks that resemble egg whites. It\u2019s stable enough to top a pie (and can even be torched) and to bake into crunchy meringues, but it doesn\u2019t have quite enough structure to hold up a tall cake or keep cookies from crumbling. For desserts that require beaten yolks and whites, like a chiffon cake, Ms. Meli suggests using aquafaba to replace the whites and flax gel for the yolks. Without whipping, aquafaba can be simply stirred into batters or doughs for squat goodies with a larger proportion of other binding ingredients, such as wheat flour or chocolate.\n3. Mashed banana or applesauce\n\nHow to Sub: Smash a very ripe banana until smooth or pur\u00e9e cooked apples (or buy applesauce with apples listed as the only ingredient). For each ingredient, 60 grams (\u00bc cup) should be used in place of each egg.\nWhat It Can Do: Add moisture, bind ingredients and provide some structure.\nWhere to Use It: Drop cookies; muffins; quick breads; pancakes; yeast rolls; carrot cake\nThe natural sweetness of these fruits should be used in treats that pair with their flavors. Banana deepens chocolate, caramel and vanilla, and applesauce enriches anything with warm spices, maple and dried fruit. The two go well with nuts. When swapping these fruits for eggs, Ms. Meli stirs in a little flavorless oil to compensate for lost richness.\nTwo other popular egg substitutes for an airy rise are carbonated water as well as a mixture of baking soda and vinegar, but Ms. Meli considers both options too unpredictable for success.\n______\nEgg Substitutes for Savory Dishes\n4. Tofu\n\nHow to Sub: Buy fresh containers and drain well.\nWhat It Can Do: Resemble creamy eggs; add moisture\nWhere to Use It: Savory egg dishes; creamy sauces\nWhen seasoned with bold flavors and stirred well in a pan, firm tofu tastes pretty close to scrambled eggs. Silken tofu blends into a smooth pur\u00e9e that mimics the creaminess you get from sauces like hollandaise; you can substitute a tablespoon per yolk and add some butter or oil for richness.\n5. Mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, or pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n\nHow to Sub: Make plain, creamy mashed potatoes or buy canned sweet potato or pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Use 60 grams (\u00bc cup) per whole egg.\nWhat It Can Do: Bind ingredients; act as glue\nWhere to Use It: Meatballs; meatloaf; breaded meat\nThese starchy vegetables help ground meat mixtures hold together and crumb coatings cling to chicken cutlets or pork chops destined for pan-frying. Mashed potatoes make the most sense for savory dishes and lend a buttery, creamy flavor. For dishes with warm spices, try sweet potatoes or pumpkin. In all cases, be sure to use a very thin coating for breading meat.\nSome of our favorite eggless recipes for dishes that normally include eggs:\n\nVegan Chocolate Cupcakes | Vegan Brownies With Tahini and Halvah| Peanut-Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies | Strawberry Spoon Cake | Vegan Banana Bread | Breakfast Tofu Scramble | Chicken Miso Meatballs", "articleSection": "Food", "author": "Genevieve Ko", "copyrightHolder": {"@id": "https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher", "@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "The New York Times"}, "copyrightYear": 2025, "dateModified": "2025-02-10T18:59:07.630Z", "datePublished": "2025-01-13T18:29:06.000Z", "description": "No one ingredient can replace everything an egg can do in a recipe, but these easy replacements come close.", "headline": "How to Substitute Eggs for Baking and Cooking", "image": [{"@id": "nyt://image/f3130062-48d2-532d-96e4-550f5f1831d0#videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/11/dining/09Eggs-Shells/merlin_205206762_60e39201-c93e-41c4-996d-d1d4eb8ca2aa-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "creditText": "Sang An for The New York Times.

And yes, you can also swap out the fruit for an equal amount of raspberries, blackberries, currants, or whatever else looks good at the farmers market.\nThe recipe came to us via one of our Best New Restaurants for 2012, Cakes & Ale in Decatur, Georgia (now closed). Like many coffee cakes, it\u2019s all about a mix of textures: the crumb should be moist and not overly dense, while the streusel topping should have a pleasing crunch that gives way to a burst of juicy berries. To achieve this, be sure to add the eggs to the mixing bowl one at a time and beat them thoroughly, which introduces air to the batter and ensures each ingredient is properly incorporated (a stand mixer is helpful here, but a hand mixer also works).\nWhen you\u2019re layering, start with half the cake batter, then a ribbon of cinnamon sugar, followed by more batter, blueberries tossed in breadcrumbs (which soak up excess moisture and keep the berries from sinking to the bottom of the cake pan), and finally the buttery crumble topping. If you\u2019d like, a dusting of powdered sugar wouldn\u2019t be out of place, but we prefer this coffee cake without.

I think the risk you run buying TNF gear online is that you might accidentally wind up with something geared more towards the instagram crowd instead of something that will actually work in the outdoors. Fortunately this piece seems to be the latter. It&apos;s thicker than it appears in the images, and seems well-built. Definitely more of a mid-weight than a mini-puff, and the underarm things do seem to help with movement. It does kind of puff up around the belly area, but I feel like most jackets of this weight will do that. It&apos;s light-ish, and it does fit into the chest pocket as advertised. As stated earlier it is a bit thicker than it appears in the images, and when I tried it on under my not-very-baggy jacket that I&apos;ve been using as a shell the whole thing looked and felt kind of tight.

Also, without the cord, it makes the jacket look pretty boxy, which can make you look kind of bulky and square.", "name": "Great jack with an drawback", "@type": "Review", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "QG"}, "reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3, "@type": "Rating"}}], "aggregateRating": 4.428571428571429, "name": "Terra Peak Jacket - Men&apos;s"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "jackets for hiking in the foothills of the Nilgiris"}

I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect but it is exactly as I\u2019d hoped. I wanted a light jacket that would provide some coverage from the wind gusts as I reached peaks and summits during my hikes. This jacket does so well. It is not wind proof and does not advertise to be. It\u2019s a very light material and you can see light through it when held to a bulb. The stretch fabric feels wonderful. It may not be as stretchy as elastane but it is surprisingly stretchy given the texture of the jacket. The hood performs well and can be adjusted with two drawstrings and cinch cords. There is a small zipped chest pocket and two zipped hand pockets. I can access the chest pocket easily when wearing a pack. If I get too warm I just unzip the pockets and let the mesh liner ventilate some heat. The cuffs are elastic and I find they fit well. I have small wrists and they don\u2019t fall up my arm. I love this jacket so much I own two. The Savanna color is exactly what I wanted, like a light olive and tan color. The jacket can be packed down very small. It can be packed into its own pocket but I\u2019ve also found it easy to roll it into the hood. The weight is feather like but I\u2019ve worn it a few times when carrying my pack and noticed zero durability issues thus far. I have also been using this in mild Autumn weather as an extra protective layer. I find when I wear this over my Keb Fleece Hoodie, it adds just enough extra warmth when needed. The jacket breathes exceptionally well. I find it comparable to the Ferrosi jacket, just with less synthetic materials. I am well pleased with the design of this jacket. I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d 150lbs and could fit a small or medium. The small was very fitting but comfortable due to the stretch of the jacket.

It&apos;s proportions are good: I got an L, which is OK alone, but big enough to layer atop 2 shirts; the arm and tail lengths are generous, and the collar, made with two thicknesses of fleece, stands high enough for some neck warmth.  \n\nThe zippers are strong, not undersized or weak like others, and include pull cords/tabs.  The hand pockets are roomy, and set above the waist, so don&apos;t create a bottom-edge bulge.   The inner phone pocket is roomy and secure.  There&apos;s a webbed front inner lining.  The jacket bottom edge is wrapped and elasticized, and it&apos;s wrapping carries up the front zipper to the top of the collar, features which both help keep wind out.

I was in 10-30 degrees (mostly sunny and little wind) for 6 days on the slopes and had no complaints whatsoever. If I got warm, the vents were nice and opening up the front was simple with gloves.

She&apos;s one of the few characters that has some depth, motivation, and sense of fun.\n\nJason Momoa wasn&apos;t bad as a menacing AI, but he wasn&apos;t a character to empathize with - or even to love to hate. He ultimately had the 2 dimensional motivation of an AI following his programming, but with a maniacal murder streak. Without a truly 3 dimensional villain, he may as well be a glitchy computer or one with a loose wire. He seems to want to kill and torture... just because. Senseless violence is boring.\n\nSome CGI was really entertaining. The best parts being those that blend into the scenes - like e-mail in their heads up displays. Parts of the ship were well done. The exterior shots were very well done.\n\nHonestly, I think I&apos;d have enjoyed the movie more without the killer AI - just fleshing out the prisoner characters&apos; backgrounds and interactions more and their frustrations with the limitations of their freedoms. The movie is like a bad episode of Outer Limits where we get little exposition and narrative followed by mindless violence / action sequences meant perhaps to visually impress, but utterly lacking substance. Just having Momoa on a monitor talking was more menacing and entertaining than the whole opening sequence of the movie.\n\nDavid Hewlett is one of my favorite actors. I applaud his effort in writing and directing a full length film. It&apos;s better than many made- for-TV Syfy channel craptastic flicks of the month. I think with some work, we could see this again in another form with more well rounded characters and a better story arc for the &quot;heroes&quot; and villain.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend the movie, but there are worse ways to spend your time. I&apos;d describe it as having elements of Cube, Jason X, and Hackers.

In my view, the truth is in the middle and the average vote of currently 5.8 seems justified. &quot;Natural City&quot; is by no means a movie on the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; level. Take away the futuristic eye-candy, and what is left? A man is in love with a cyborg lady without really telling us why, how or what for. Real character development is not happening! He gets in a conflict with his friend over the cyborgs which leads to gratuitous violence with faces covered in blood like in a million action flicks before. Meanwhile, a girl plants flowers in a roof garden to provide a contrast to the post-war destruction scenery around. &quot;Natural City&quot; doesn&apos;t really have any new ideas, it simply spices up the collection of familiar trade marks with &quot;Matrix/Equilibrium Next Generation&quot; visuals which is fine for web 2.0 designers but not for the art of film making. Everybody who truly believes this is going to be a classic should go watch &quot;Soylent Green&quot; where it was the actors and the story that mattered. \n\nStill, &quot;Natural City&quot; is a movie that has its touching or stunning moments. Actually, I liked that explanations were not provided in many cases. One might argue whether it is a deliberate attempt to open it for interpretation or simply plot holes. But I think, if we once really caught a glimpse of the year 2080, there would be much that we won&apos;t comprehend, either. You know how silly SF movies of the 1950s seem today because they applied manners, moral standards and ways of conversation that are outdated.

And better yet, it is a story which raises a lot of questions in the audience as you view it, in terms of your own views on the issues being dealt with throughout the movie. And for a movie to be able to raise that kind of questions, that is something that I find rather impressive.\n\nThe special effects and CGI effects in &quot;Amelia 2.0&quot; were quite good and really worked in favor of the movie. And for a Sci-Fi movie of this nature then having special effects is definitely a plus. If the movie had less impressive CGI, then the movie would have been much less enjoyable or convincing.\n\n&quot;Amelie 2.0&quot; has an ensemble of good acting talents, which were for the most part new faces to me. And I do enjoy watching new actors and actresses on the screen, as there are no associations to other previous characters linked to the performers. So that was a definite plus in my book. The actors and actresses in the movie were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters, and that was working well in favor of the movie.\n\nDirector Adam Orton did a great job in bringing writer Rob Merritt&apos;s story to life on the screen.\n\nThe characters in the movie are quite well-rounded and they have very distinct personalities and traits. And the dialogue throughout the course of the movie was well written and delivered by the various actors and actresses.\n\nThe movie makes use of way too many short shots of random and pointless images that serves absolutely no purpose to the movie, aside from being fillers. That was particularly true for the first 10-15 minutes of the movie.\n\nI really enjoyed how this movie raises some issues and questions about humanity, the ability to replace the body in parts or as a whole, and how the soul fits into all of this if you take a religious stand on it. But also how traditional and inbred thinking stands in the way of technological advancement and the fear of embracing new and innovating things that break up with how things traditionally are and have been for a long, long time.\n\nI have a feeling that this movie might be very underrated and slip under most people&apos;s radar. However, I can most strongly recommend that you take the time to sit down to watch &quot;Amelia 2.0&quot; if you have the chance.\n\nThe ending of the movie was not really one that did the movie or the storyline much justice, and it felt just like it was a very, very wrong way to end the movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "aggregateRating": 5.3, "contentRating": "Not Rated", "genre": ["Drama", "Romance", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2021-02-12", "keywords": "robot,robot sci fi,low budget sci fi movie", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Amelia 2.0", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3044915481", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE1NTkxMTktMjJkMy00ODdjLWEyOWUtMmJjODllZTZkZmViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE1NTkxMTktMjJkMy00ODdjLWEyOWUtMmJjODllZTZkZmViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3044915481/", "description": "Trailer for Amelia 2.0", "duration": "PT2M34S", "uploadDate": "2017-09-22T16:01:15Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000893/", "name": "Ed Begley Jr."}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0933281/", "name": "Debra Wilson"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0894690/", "name": "Kate Vernon"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4178630/", "name": "Adam Orton"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0246924/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0229781/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6597099/", "name": "Rob Merritt"}], "duration": "PT1H29M"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "movies that involve an AI, but that portray the AI in a good light"}

I was really disappointed at how a film with as much good promise as it did turned out so pointless and aimless. The animation is mostly very sloppy, with flat colours and most of the characters lack fluidity in how they move. The story lets it down hugely too, there is nothing to it, it is very thin in construction and pedestrian in pace. The only slight sparks are with Antoinette&apos;s appearance and to a lesser extent the action scenes which are disappointingly brief and rushed otherwise. The dialogue plods, the characters are indifferent and static, the music is forgettable and the voice work and lip movements are bland and poor.

I walked away quite liking this movie.\n\nMost of the complaints are around technical/realism stupidities, or else being a rip-off of previous movies.\n\nRe stupidities: there are plenty, most of the negative reviews are correct, but they miss the point, which is given a more or less silly premise, do the characters fulfill their struggle properly.\n\nFor me the answer is strong yes, I tend to respond to the emotions a movie is trying to convey, ultimately this is a story of loss and love, a nice universal theme that always resonates.\n\nGiven that theme, the movie&apos;s style, effects, music all worked really well to reinforce that. I liked all the performances.\n\nBe careful about critiquing modern SF movies about technical stupidities too much. Most of these have a fatal flaw that would destroy most of them. How about the likelihood of star travel? OK, you have to grant that otherwise most SF movies pretty much fall flat.\n\nBut still, the basic premise is not realistic: a star faring race, searching for energy, is not going to bother going to earth for its water, that is so much more easily available anywhere else, energy itself is much more easily accessible without playing with water for fusion, just stay with your own star, mine your own asteroid belt or gas giants.\n\nSure, it makes no sense for the Tet to make and use human clones, but given that, do we have a good story? I think so.\n\nTo me, valid criticisms are when characters, immersed in their realities such as they are, do not act true to their nature. And thus a movie like Prometheus failed since there the highly trained biology experts acted like complete morons.\n\nBut that is not the case here. In this movie we have passion, loss, and love, the struggle to persevere.\n\nPlus the drones looked really really cool.\n\nRe copying other movies: get over it. This movie is distinct enough to feel its own. I saw and loved Moon (which granted is the better movie), but I enjoyed this one for what it was.\n\nI think it helped for me to not see any trailers, and to come in with low expectations after hearing about bad reviews.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "aggregateRating": 7, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2013-04-19", "keywords": "post apocalypse,alien invasion,drone,memory,erased memory", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Version 2", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi498116121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzU4NDc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU1NzgxOQ@@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi498116121/", "description": "A court martial sends a veteran soldier to a distant planet, where he has to destroy the remains of an alien race.

I love the show Real Humans (2012\u2013 ) &quot;\u00c4kta m\u00e4nniskor&quot; from Sweden. In that show they called the Robots, Hubots- best name ever. Now it has been remade for the UK/US version, (not nearly as good as the Swedish version). Still good. Those shows take the theme of Uncanny further.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "aggregateRating": 6.2, "contentRating": "Not Rated", "genre": ["Drama", "Horror", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2016-06-22", "keywords": "robot pretending to be human,cell phone photograph,education,psychotronic film,man wears eyeglasses", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Uncanny", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2010233881", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQ0ZWJjZGUtMDU3Yi00ZGI3LWE4ZGEtNjQ5Nzk2MTI3MDYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTQ0ZWJjZGUtMDU3Yi00ZGI3LWE4ZGEtNjQ5Nzk2MTI3MDYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2010233881/", "description": "Official Trailer Uncanny", "duration": "PT2M7S", "uploadDate": "2019-05-17T17:16:44.876Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0916406/", "name": "Mark Webber"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1134641/", "name": "David Clayton Rogers"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2189625/", "name": "Lucy Griffiths"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505075/", "name": "Matthew Leutwyler"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0480254/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0389577/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2839612/", "name": "Shahin Chandrasoma"}], "duration": "PT1H25M"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "movies that involve an AI, but that portray the AI in a good light"}

I am happy because it is a nice movie which dares to blend genres, manages to keep the SciFi &quot;Real&quot;and even manages to find a pretty effective end to literally an impossible love story but I felt disappointed that it may be a bit difficult to savor for the masses and it doesn&apos;t excite as much as its potential.\n\nIt is a feel good movie with nice performances that should do well but if it doesn&apos;t then it will be looked back on kindly and with positivity as time passes. The basic premise of the movie is clear from the trailer - Man falls for a cutting edge very Human like Robot and wants to get married. So it is pretty difficult to imagine a satisfying and still &quot;realistic&quot; ending for the movie. I commend the writers on finding a pretty good ending which feels like it can be a real possibility and doesn&apos;t become a standard &quot;Kuch Bhi&quot; happy Bollywood ending. It is also good that the story not only shows the potential of AI but also comments on the nascency of our understanding of AI and its potential impact. This ending is going to be very hard for the masses to digest. I hope it isn&apos;t too good for its own good.\n\nKriti looks stunning and is pretty well cast as the Android and Shahid looks blindly in love with her. The support cast is good. Dharmendra is good and a pleasure to watch but somewhat wasted in the role. The music and songs are catchy. The jokes are funny. The movie has all the right pieces to become a hit but its theme, genre and well executed but difficult to satisfy ending may be the biggest challenge to it has to overcome For me the biggest negative of the movie is that we have already seen way too much of the movie in the trailer and songs. There are additional funny bits and the ending is completely fresh and new but the trailer feels like almost a 2 minute version of the movie without the ending sequence. The movie is entertaining and the right step towards making new types of movies. I liked the movie. I appreciate this daring effort at a new kind of Romcom. I even applaud the difficult to satisfy ending....but I didnt love the movie. 7/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "aggregateRating": 6.2, "genre": ["Comedy", "Drama", "Romance"], "datePublished": "2024-02-09", "keywords": "dream,girl,young,evil,man", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer [OV]", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2523842329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlmZTY1OTYtMjQ3My00ZGQzLWFjZWUtNjYyMGFiY2MyNDZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODlmZTY1OTYtMjQ3My00ZGQzLWFjZWUtNjYyMGFiY2MyNDZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2523842329/", "description": "", "duration": "PT2M57S", "uploadDate": "2024-01-19T05:11:04.769Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1372788/", "name": "Shahid Kapoor"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5305841/", "name": "Kriti Sanon"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004429/", "name": "Dharmendra"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8552307/", "name": "Amit Joshi"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13040033/", "name": "Aradhana Sah"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0732324/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0481480/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8552307/", "name": "Amit Joshi"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13040033/", "name": "Aradhana Sah"}], "duration": "PT2H21M"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "movies that involve an AI, but that portray the AI in a good light"}

It is a mixture of Spielberg&apos;s wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick&apos;s cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio.\n\nThe film is set in a future where the ice caps have melted and eradicated the coastline. Robots of increasing sophistication have become part of the fabric of society. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has created an android with programme to love and be more human like.\n\nMonica and Henry Swinton (Frances O&apos;Connor and Sam Robards) have a terminally ill son and take in David (Haley Joel Osment) almost as a substitute son to love. David as he is programmed is fixated on his mother and projects his love.\n\nWhen their son Martin (Jake Thomas) miraculously recovers and returns home, the new family of four becomes fractious. Martin is mean to David who cannot interact with other kids. It is not in his programming. An incident means that like a dangerous pet, he could be dangerous in the house. However Monica is not willing to send him back to the corporation where he would be presumably terminated.\n\nMonica cares enough for David to abandon him in the woods with a Teddy Bear who is also an AI robot for companionship and wisdom (his Jiminy Cricket.) From there David befriends other robots such as Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sex-bot on the run after being framed for murder. They evade resentful humans and journey to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy so his mother can love him.\n\nDavid is a boy who becomes accepted quickly by becoming part of a family only to find that he is not afforded their protection when he is gauded and provoked by Martin. Once in he wilds with Gigolo Joe he is living in fear in a society where robots have no rights.\n\nSpielberg creates two sound stages for the middle of his film. Flesh Fair a gaudy, sleazy place where robots are destroyed in front of cheering humans but David pleads for his life and swings the crowd his way. Then there is Rouge City, A Vegas type place where the holographic Dr Know points them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flood hit of Manhattan where he meets his creator, Professor Hobby.\n\nThe final act set in the submerged Coney Island which is then frozen over in an oncoming ice age until David is rescued by advanced beings.\n\nI have to confess. I liked the ending. It bought an emotional crescendo to a flawed film. It moved me as it allows David to find he is the recipient of love and can finally grow and become human even if it is all a projection from the beings that rescued him. Without this ending, I would had found this to be a dull, uninvolving and grim experience. Humans treating robots like pets who are soon discarded once they are no longer fulfil a useful function.\n\nI understand that this ending was part of the Kubrick draft and not added by Spielberg. Kubrick finally showed his sentimental side.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "aggregateRating": 7.2, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2001-06-29", "keywords": "synthetic human,mother son relationship,artificially created boy,robot human relationship,child abuse", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A.I.

All I really remembered was cool robots and a complicated story involving time travel and a plague, which was about enough to convince me to give it a second shot when it appeared on TV, since the passage of years has given early 90&apos;s straight to video science fiction of this sort a curious fascination for me that actually outstrips the excitement that they originally induced. Remarkably A.P.E.X. actually repaid my interest, its certainly no classic but as far as its genre goes it certainly ain&apos;t too bad. The key is the plot, the film deals in a pretty interesting science fiction concept with a neat emotional hook for its main character. Basically, a mishap involving an exploratory time travelling robot results in our hero landing in a parallel reality that has branched off from his own, confronting him with his greatest fear, that of losing his beloved wife. The film tries to deal with post apocalyptic themes, parallel worlds and the consequences of paradoxes upon the time line, and though it can&apos;t quite keep itself together its imaginative and intriguing stuff. The plot actually holds up better than a number of reviews here would suggest, although there are one or two notable holes and clear contrivances. Despite problems the ambition is laudable, it&apos;s just a shame that the same ambition didn&apos;t carry over to the action, which mostly consists of repetitious shoots outs with robots. The pyrotechnics budget was clearly decent so there are plenty of explosions, plus the robots are pretty cool, shining golden creates with ridge plated armour and both shoulder and hand cannons. But the action gets dull pretty quickly and neither the robots nor humans have realistic or interesting tactics. Acting turns do a better than expected job of sustaining interest, though nobody is much more than merely &quot;there&quot; certain of the cast do convey a certain sympathy and interest. Richard Keats for example as the hero, he can&apos;t put across much reaction to the situation but is likable enough, Lisa Anne Russell has a sullen attractiveness, Marcus Aurelius appropriately grating as the token a-hole character, it&apos;s all fair enough for this level of film. Some of the writing works, some doesn&apos;t and while I appreciated that the film wasn&apos;t bogged down with techno-babble it could have done with a bit more explanation. The direction from Philip J. Roth (who turned out to be a low budget sci fi regular and also wrote the film) is occasionally stylish in its use of lighting, with green, red and dark moments put to good effect, he has a fair handling on atmosphere but I wish he had put more flair into the action. Altogether I thought this was a fair enough film. Only likely to appeal to sci fi buffs and they&apos;ll probably have a field day tearing it apart, but I had a reasonable enough time. 5/10 from me then.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 5}}, "aggregateRating": 4.4, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "1994-05-14", "keywords": "robot,robot sci fi,dystopian future,terminator,killer robot", "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444196/", "name": "Richard Keats"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185168/", "name": "Mitchell Cox"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0751295/", "name": "Lisa Ann Russell"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0744985/", "name": "Phillip J.

Judge it as that... of course it&apos;s not perfect, as the people behind it are still finding out which of their ideas work on screen and which don&apos;t. This film then, for the most part works, and if you think it over afterwards it works even better.\n\nYou gotta admire the vision and care that went into each of the 4 stories that each touch on a different side of the same subject: how humans relate to machines and then relate back to real life. The story about the comatose boy his mother and his action figures was especially touching, as was the one about the older man that just wants to die, both beautiful roles by the mother and the sculptor. It seems the director is at best when making a &apos;small&apos; story, he does it with a tenderness and visual power rarely seen. This leaves the actors plenty of room to present their characters in subtle ways and not having to carry the weight of the story by overacting.\n\nThe acting from the predominantly Asian cast is very good, and it&apos;s nice to see asians in a non-stereotypical role in American film. The imagery shows the low budget, but the locations are well chosen and it&apos;s well directed. The only weak point is when it gets exciting the director has trouble picking up the pace and really conveying the sense of fear and adrenaline the characters must feel. These moments are very sporadic (just one in the first story..my least favorite anyway).\n\nThis is a movie to watch, if you have an open mind and can relate to the people on screen. If you&apos;re looking for more traditional sci-fi themes.. look further. Calling this movie sci-fi just because it deals with robots is missing the point. This is more geared towards drama.

It boasts excellent visual effects, as well as an engaging and intelligent story. While it borrows from other science fiction it does so successfully, especially the atmospheric and decaying world we&apos;re thrusts into from the beginning.\n\nThe story centers around Antonio Banderas&apos;s character, Jacq Vaucan - a world-weary insurance agent for a robotics corporation whose job is to investigate robots violating their protocols which are one: harming any form of life, and two: they can neither repair themselves nor alter another robot in any fashion. On the trail of a robot Vaucan discovers a robot stealing parts in an apparent attempt to alter itself. This leads him to the clock master - a fixer who may have just succeeded the second protocol.\n\nAutomata is a throwback to thoughtful science fiction. It&apos;s not for the feint of heart but if you&apos;re engaged and buy into the world and the premise then you&apos;ll be rewarded. The film surprised me in a lot of ways - especially for such a relatively small budget but imagery is fantastic and the effects are mostly practical, and built with little computer generated imagery save for some backgrounds and action scenes which make it that much more realistic.\n\nIt&apos;s slower and probably has less action but if we&apos;re comparing it to what it will inevitably be compared to, &apos;I Robot&apos;, Automata is a better movie. More thoughtful, grittier and executed a whole lot better visually. It&apos;s not a perfect flick by any means but it&apos;s worth watching and deciding for yourself.\n\n7.5/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "aggregateRating": 6, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Action", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2014-10-17", "keywords": "robot,future,dystopia,sex robot,child hitman", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2069933081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MTQ3NjgzMjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDczMzAzNTIx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA3MTQ3NjgzMjJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDczMzAzNTIx._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi2069933081/", "description": "Jacq Vaucan, an insurance agent of ROC robotics corporation, routinely investigates the case of manipulating a robot.

Chris Columbus directs this with flair and he makes something really good here, and quite entertaining. Due to some scenes, this may upset younger viewers, but this is sure to appeal to anyone looking for something unique to watch. I can see why some people may dislike this one, but I on the other hand found it very entertaining and very well done. The special effects are truly wonderful and they add so much to the film. I thought that Robin Williams was truly great in the lead role. This is a fine drama that manages to overcome its shortcomings due to its heart. The cast are wonderful and they elevate the material significantly. Bicentennial Man is not perfect, but it definitely entertaining and is worth watching. Chris Columbus has directed something truly incredible that is very much underrated and like I said does not deserve the flack it has received. Of course Columbus has made better films in his career, but this is an overlooked gem that definitely is worth your time. Robin Williams is a good actor and he deserves credit in giving the film its charm as well as some humor here and there to lighten the tone of the drama. There are things that could have been done better, but overall the film really soars above the negative aspects that all the negative reviews have pointed out.

Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a &quot;pre-crime&quot; unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.\n\nWe learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.\n\nSpielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black &amp; white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noir&apos;s morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.\n\nBut this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that&apos;s going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.\n\nThis is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.\n\n&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; ~ film noir &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; ~ science fiction &quot;Blade Runner&quot; ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)\n\n***** out of *****"}, "aggregateRating": 7.6, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Action", "Crime", "Mystery"], "datePublished": "2002-06-21", "keywords": "year 2054,future noir,neo noir,reference to virtual reality,man with no eyes", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Minority Report", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3333161241", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3333161241/", "description": "Trailer", "duration": "PT31S", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:25:05Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/", "name": "Colin Farrell"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608090/", "name": "Samantha Morton"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/", "name": "Steven Spielberg"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0000756/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0819670/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0012382/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0291082/", "name": "Scott Frank"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169509/", "name": "Jon Cohen"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001140/", "name": "Philip K.

Then, eventually, we see that he is older than his robot, so he&apos;s &quot;cheating&quot; on age too. Even later still, maybe we&apos;d see an obese person at home posing as an athlete via a surrogate which looks nothing like him. Well, &quot;Surrogates&quot; skips all that build up and goes straight for the punchline: within 10 minutes we see a hot chick robot making with a young man; turns out the hot chick is actually slovenly a middle-aged man.

It boasts excellent visual effects, as well as an engaging and intelligent story. While it borrows from other science fiction it does so successfully, especially the atmospheric and decaying world we&apos;re thrusts into from the beginning.\n\nThe story centers around Antonio Banderas&apos;s character, Jacq Vaucan - a world-weary insurance agent for a robotics corporation whose job is to investigate robots violating their protocols which are one: harming any form of life, and two: they can neither repair themselves nor alter another robot in any fashion. On the trail of a robot Vaucan discovers a robot stealing parts in an apparent attempt to alter itself. This leads him to the clock master - a fixer who may have just succeeded the second protocol.\n\nAutomata is a throwback to thoughtful science fiction. It&apos;s not for the feint of heart but if you&apos;re engaged and buy into the world and the premise then you&apos;ll be rewarded. The film surprised me in a lot of ways - especially for such a relatively small budget but imagery is fantastic and the effects are mostly practical, and built with little computer generated imagery save for some backgrounds and action scenes which make it that much more realistic.\n\nIt&apos;s slower and probably has less action but if we&apos;re comparing it to what it will inevitably be compared to, &apos;I Robot&apos;, Automata is a better movie. More thoughtful, grittier and executed a whole lot better visually.

When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It&apos;s hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you&apos;re able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you&apos;re in for a fun ride.

She&apos;s one of the few characters that has some depth, motivation, and sense of fun.\n\nJason Momoa wasn&apos;t bad as a menacing AI, but he wasn&apos;t a character to empathize with - or even to love to hate. He ultimately had the 2 dimensional motivation of an AI following his programming, but with a maniacal murder streak. Without a truly 3 dimensional villain, he may as well be a glitchy computer or one with a loose wire. He seems to want to kill and torture... just because. Senseless violence is boring.\n\nSome CGI was really entertaining. The best parts being those that blend into the scenes - like e-mail in their heads up displays. Parts of the ship were well done. The exterior shots were very well done.\n\nHonestly, I think I&apos;d have enjoyed the movie more without the killer AI - just fleshing out the prisoner characters&apos; backgrounds and interactions more and their frustrations with the limitations of their freedoms. The movie is like a bad episode of Outer Limits where we get little exposition and narrative followed by mindless violence / action sequences meant perhaps to visually impress, but utterly lacking substance. Just having Momoa on a monitor talking was more menacing and entertaining than the whole opening sequence of the movie.\n\nDavid Hewlett is one of my favorite actors. I applaud his effort in writing and directing a full length film. It&apos;s better than many made- for-TV Syfy channel craptastic flicks of the month. I think with some work, we could see this again in another form with more well rounded characters and a better story arc for the &quot;heroes&quot; and villain.\n\nI wouldn&apos;t recommend the movie, but there are worse ways to spend your time. I&apos;d describe it as having elements of Cube, Jason X, and Hackers. I&apos;m hoping this was a proof of concept flick to show that David Hewlett is ready to take the helm of something larger.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 4}}, "aggregateRating": 4.3, "contentRating": "Not Rated", "genre": ["Horror", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2015-06-12", "keywords": "artificial intelligence,artificial intelligence sci fi,low budget sci fi movie,b sci fi,young", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Debug", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi775797273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcxNjE2YTQtY2VlNC00YWM5LWJiOGMtYjE1OWFjMzRmZjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTcxNjE2YTQtY2VlNC00YWM5LWJiOGMtYjE1OWFjMzRmZjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi775797273/", "description": "Trailer for Debug", "duration": "PT1M6S", "uploadDate": "2018-12-28T17:08:48.954Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2476500/", "name": "Tenika Davis"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0597388/", "name": "Jason Momoa"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0391738/", "name": "Adrian Holmes"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382110/", "name": "David Hewlett"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0028055/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0447878/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0382110/", "name": "David Hewlett"}], "duration": "PT1H26M"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "now, how about some that portray AI as a killer machine"}

It is a mixture of Spielberg&apos;s wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick&apos;s cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio.\n\nThe film is set in a future where the ice caps have melted and eradicated the coastline. Robots of increasing sophistication have become part of the fabric of society. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has created an android with programme to love and be more human like.\n\nMonica and Henry Swinton (Frances O&apos;Connor and Sam Robards) have a terminally ill son and take in David (Haley Joel Osment) almost as a substitute son to love. David as he is programmed is fixated on his mother and projects his love.\n\nWhen their son Martin (Jake Thomas) miraculously recovers and returns home, the new family of four becomes fractious. Martin is mean to David who cannot interact with other kids. It is not in his programming. An incident means that like a dangerous pet, he could be dangerous in the house. However Monica is not willing to send him back to the corporation where he would be presumably terminated.\n\nMonica cares enough for David to abandon him in the woods with a Teddy Bear who is also an AI robot for companionship and wisdom (his Jiminy Cricket.) From there David befriends other robots such as Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sex-bot on the run after being framed for murder. They evade resentful humans and journey to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy so his mother can love him.\n\nDavid is a boy who becomes accepted quickly by becoming part of a family only to find that he is not afforded their protection when he is gauded and provoked by Martin. Once in he wilds with Gigolo Joe he is living in fear in a society where robots have no rights.\n\nSpielberg creates two sound stages for the middle of his film. Flesh Fair a gaudy, sleazy place where robots are destroyed in front of cheering humans but David pleads for his life and swings the crowd his way. Then there is Rouge City, A Vegas type place where the holographic Dr Know points them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flood hit of Manhattan where he meets his creator, Professor Hobby.\n\nThe final act set in the submerged Coney Island which is then frozen over in an oncoming ice age until David is rescued by advanced beings.\n\nI have to confess. I liked the ending. It bought an emotional crescendo to a flawed film. It moved me as it allows David to find he is the recipient of love and can finally grow and become human even if it is all a projection from the beings that rescued him. Without this ending, I would had found this to be a dull, uninvolving and grim experience. Humans treating robots like pets who are soon discarded once they are no longer fulfil a useful function.\n\nI understand that this ending was part of the Kubrick draft and not added by Spielberg. Kubrick finally showed his sentimental side.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "aggregateRating": 7.2, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Adventure", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "2001-06-29", "keywords": "synthetic human,mother son relationship,artificially created boy,robot human relationship,child abuse", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A.I.

Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott&apos;s adaptation of Philip K. Dick&apos;s post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story &apos;Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep&apos; is a visionary work of art; it&apos;s a dystopian masterpiece and I&apos;d personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick&apos;s &apos;2001&apos; (and be advised to watch the version known as the &quot;final cut&quot; if you want to catch &apos;Blade Runner&apos; as it was intended by its director). \n\nIt&apos;s hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as &quot;cyberpunk&quot;, and it was also the first &quot;film noir&quot; in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere &quot;eye candy&quot;, it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"}, "aggregateRating": 8.1, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Action", "Drama", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "1982-06-25", "keywords": "tech noir,cyberpunk,police detective,dystopia,existentialism", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Blade Runner", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi531759385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwOTM1Mjk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwOTM1Mjk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi531759385/", "description": "Blade Runner Trailer", "duration": "PT1M2S", "uploadDate": "2007-11-27T09:22:44Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000148/", "name": "Harrison Ford"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000442/", "name": "Rutger Hauer"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000707/", "name": "Sean Young"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/", "name": "Ridley Scott"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0042559/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0484967/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0002663/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266684/", "name": "Hampton Fancher"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0672459/", "name": "David Webb Peoples"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001140/", "name": "Philip K.

First of all, it is very clear that half of this movie is from stock footage.  It is also clear that they used multiple takes of the same scene (or maybe it was actually the same take) a few different times in the movie.  Good guy rounds the corner, shoots two bad guy.  Same good guy, same corner, two minutes later, shoots two more bad guys.  Same corner a few minutes later...  Then there are the scenes where you see someone shooting on one set, and blowing someone up on a different set entirely.\n\nThen there was the acting.  Even without the movie being dubbed the acting was terrible.  It is like watching the first earliest rehearsals of an elementary school play.  The only people who don&apos;t entirely underact are the ones who entirely overact!\n\nHow about the set?  With a name like Bronx Executioner, taking place (supposedly) in the south Bronx in the relatively new future, you would expect to see a city.  Or at least a run down city.  Or at least the ruins of a city.  Nope.  There are beat up looking factories in the middle of dirt fields.  A castle in the middle of the woods.  Another scene seems to take place in a quarry...  No cities anywhere, a couple of country roads through he middle of nowhere, and a couple of beat up looking factories, that&apos;s it.\n\nAlso, going to the plot of the movie...  This is a movie about the humanoids fighting the androids.  Both humanoids and androids are factory reject robots.  So of course when they get shot they bled.  Okay, some of them spark a little bit, but that is more muzzle flash than anything.  Basically they all look human, and act human (alright they act like bad actors trying to act like robots trying to act human) and there is no way to tell they aren&apos;t human in the movie.  Well, one guy does die and reveal some circuits where the gaping hole in his neck appeared.  Of course, you couldn&apos;t see a head or a body in that one shot, so it is hard to tell.  Also they were really fragile robots.  I mean when a human can kill a robot with a couple of karate chops you know they are weak.  Also in all the slaughter scenes, there are never any wounded.  They are all either dead, or escaped.  The only robot to even last a few seconds after they got fatally wounded was a &quot;good guy&quot; robot who got to say something &quot;human&quot;.\n\nPersonally I hate MST3K, but this movie is perfect for that sort of treatment.  Or better yet, redub the whole movie to be a comedy instead. Some of the stuff that happens in this movie is just too funny not to be made fun of.  Like the good guy robot goes to the sheriff for help.  The sheriff says that he is staying out of it.  Both actors just stand there waiting while the earlier soundbite that says he has to help those who ask gets played back.  Then he immediately apologizes and agrees to help.  &quot;No I can&apos;t help you, i can&apos;t get involved.... [pause for soundbite]...  I&apos;m sorry, I will help you.&quot;\n\nThis movie is truly spectacularly bad.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 2}}, "aggregateRating": 3.2, "contentRating": "R", "genre": ["Action", "Crime", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "1989-06-08", "keywords": "cyborg sci fi,police officer shot in the chest,guard dog,police officer kicked,cyborg", "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330923/", "name": "Gabriele Gori"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0628556/", "name": "Margie Newton"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0884110/", "name": "Chuck Valenti"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0024825/", "name": "Vanio Amici"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0089312/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0008792/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0024825/", "name": "Vanio Amici"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716701/", "name": "Piero Regnoli"}], "duration": "PT1H32M"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "now, how about some that portray AI as a killer machine"}

The actors are horrible, unable to even hold a basic conversation in a human fashion. The camera is horrible, capturing willingly minutes of exposition dialog while being unable to show what&apos;s happening during action sequences. And the script is horrible as i am still not sure what was actually happening here.\n\nThe general plot is very genereric. There is lots and lots of boring exposition dialog as filler.

I was really disappointed at how a film with as much good promise as it did turned out so pointless and aimless. The animation is mostly very sloppy, with flat colours and most of the characters lack fluidity in how they move. The story lets it down hugely too, there is nothing to it, it is very thin in construction and pedestrian in pace. The only slight sparks are with Antoinette&apos;s appearance and to a lesser extent the action scenes which are disappointingly brief and rushed otherwise. The dialogue plods, the characters are indifferent and static, the music is forgettable and the voice work and lip movements are bland and poor.

Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a &quot;pre-crime&quot; unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.\n\nWe learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.\n\nSpielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black &amp; white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noir&apos;s morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.\n\nBut this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that&apos;s going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.\n\nThis is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.\n\n&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; ~ film noir &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; ~ science fiction &quot;Blade Runner&quot; ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)\n\n***** out of *****"}, "aggregateRating": 7.6, "contentRating": "PG-13", "genre": ["Action", "Crime", "Mystery"], "datePublished": "2002-06-21", "keywords": "year 2054,future noir,neo noir,reference to virtual reality,man with no eyes", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Minority Report", "embedUrl": "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi3333161241", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3333161241/", "description": "Trailer", "duration": "PT31S", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:25:05Z"}, "actor": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/", "name": "Tom Cruise"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/", "name": "Colin Farrell"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608090/", "name": "Samantha Morton"}], "director": [{"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/", "name": "Steven Spielberg"}], "creator": [{"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0000756/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0819670/"}, {"@type": "Organization", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/company/co0012382/"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0291082/", "name": "Scott Frank"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169509/", "name": "Jon Cohen"}, {"@type": "Person", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001140/", "name": "Philip K.

I'm used to difficult hikes, so this one for me, was a moderate challenge. This hike is not for people who are out of shape, who have bad balance, a fear of heights, or people with no patience. As others have said, bring plenty of water. It was cold and mostly cloudy on my hike, so I only drank about 1 liter of water, but I brought 2 liters. Others have recommended bringing at least 2 liters for cool days and at least 3 liters or more on warmer days. The first 1.5 miles is easy, with a slight incline through the oak studded rolling hills. There are at least 10 creek crossings though, in that stretch. My boots did get a bit wet despite walking on the rocks or hopping to get across. BTW, trekking poles were pretty much a must on this hike. Then after all the creek crossings, the trail starts a more substantial climb, but nothing tricky yet. But then the trail narrows to a boot wide and more or less follows the contour of an extremely steep hillside. This goes on for a long while. You do NOT want to slip or lose your balance on this! You WILL fall down a 60 degree decline a long ways if you fall. I used the trekking poles on this risky stretch for extra balance and support, just in case. There is a small washout in the trail that's too dangerous to cross because the mountainside is so incredibly steep, so go up and around it, which wasn't hard for me to do. The mountainside eventually gets less steep, but the narrow trail now goes through chaparral brush, so keep a close eye on where the trail goes. At one point you'll cross a landslide of boulders, so watch your footing. As it continues through the sagebrush, it drops down in elevation a ways until you cross a creek. Before the creek I think, at about 4.8 miles, there is a piece of bent rebar sticking out of the trail in a horrible spot. I'm so glad I saw it in time. It is a bad tripping hazard. You'll fall facefirst into the scratchy bushes if you trip on it. So watch carefully for it! If it's rained recently, it's steep, muddy and slippery as the trail descends to the creek. My trekking poles made things so much easier here. After crossing the creek, pay attention to where the trail goes. Your GPS will be your friend from here. Previously, the trail was very easy to follow, but it requires a lot of focus to keep track of the trail as it climbs up the other side through more chaparral brush. I think you'll cross a 2nd creek before climbing back up. As you're climbing up the other side, the bushes get taller and very scratchy. Wear long pants and a long sleeve shirt or else you'll get seriously scratched up. You're going to be fighting a seemingly endless amount of overgrown brush, that will be pulling your hair, snagging on anything on your backpack, scratching up against your arms and even neck at times. As you reach the rocky ridge, the bushes thin out somewhat for some amazing views, but it gets muddy and slippery again at times. Eventually, you'll be nearing a dirt access road, but before you get there, you'll be descending into seriously thick and tall brush that's denser than ever and it really becomes hard to see where the trail goes. Once again, you'll be getting all scratched up if you aren't covering your arms and legs. Fortunately, this is short lived and you'll come to the access road. Make a mental note of where the trail meets the road or use your GPS to find it on the way back. The dirt road is a huge relief and break from all that bushwhacking. It climbs gently for that last mile or so to the summit. The summit is by the radio towers. The views are incredible! You can see Mt Tam, Diablo, the Sierras and I could even see Mount Shasta. Lake Berryessa sits in all its glory below. Heading back was about the same adventure as going up. However, I slipped a bunch of times on the way back but never fell. I also kept tripping on those stubs that were once bushes. But still never fell. When I was about 2 miles from the car I saw a huge bobcat on the hiking trail. I mean, a really big boy! When he saw me, he lowered his body like a housecat does before charging and pouncing. So I climbed a hill to flank him in order to avoid him, and he suddenly darted away. I never saw him again. Anyway, this hike is an excellent workout and a good challenge, but definitely not for the faint of heart.", "author": "Seth H"}, "sent": false, "prompt": "\n          Assign a score between 0 and 100 to the following item from {item.source_site}\n          based on how relevant it is to the user's question across all sites.\n          \n          Consider that this result is being compared against results from multiple different sites,\n          so factor in the credibility and relevance of the source site as well.\n\n          The description you generate should be in English.\n          \n          The user's question is: \"{request.query}\". \n          The item's description is: \"{item.description}\".\n          Source site: {item.source_site}\n        ", "query": "trails near stevens creek that might be good for an old person who can't go up or down steep slopes"}

The trails are dirt or clay  with rocks.  They are deeply rutted and very steep in places.  Would advice avoiding if it has been raining recently.  Some of the trails are very narrow.  A small section of the loop is on the street.     There were dog walkers sharing the trail and a rare biker.  Hiking boots and poles are very useful.  The trails are not marked well.  There are few signs.  I had to frequently check AllTrails to be sure I was on the right track and still made some wrong turns.  The loop is about 50% shaded.  There are some nice valley and neighborhood  views and from the top of sugarloaf there are expansive views of the bay.  The trees along the loop are mostly oaks which are nicely spaced so you can see the terrain.  There were alot of interesting mushrooms/fungi along the trail.  My mileage was 3.9 with 660 elevation gain (my AllTrails map mistakenly paused after 2.7 miles).  I would give this 3 stars   for the views and rate this is moderate difficulty due to the steep and rutted sections.

The surface is smooth and shiny, and the overall color is subdued, giving it a luxurious feel. The surface appears to be cracked. This is not a crack but a Kannyu (craze) and is not a quality problem. This is a phenomenon in which the glaze hardens into a crack-like state due to the difference in the degree of shrinkage between the glaze and the base material. Some potters intentionally incorporate Kannyu into their work. The cups are Japanese-style cups called Yunomi, so they do not have handles, but they are made in a shape that is easy to hold. In Japan, there is a tradition of using sets of different sizes for married couples or families. When two are used, they are called \"Meoto Yunomi (husband and wife teacups)\". They are ideal as gifts for wedding anniversaries for home use or as wedding gifts for acquaintances.

Some potters intentionally incorporate Kannyu into their work. This set of teacups is suitable for both daily use and as a gift. In Japan, it is customary for couples or lovers to use a pair of dishes of different sizes. Use it with your partner at home. Give it as a gift to a married friend. These products are suitable for such uses.

The design depicts a white cat and a black cat cuddling in the sun. The design is perfect for a break. Matcha bowls are used in the Japanese tea ceremony. It is used to serve tea called matcha.

Therefore, in addition to tea, it is also suitable for soup and other drinks that require a small spoon. The cup is made in a shape that is easy to hold with both hands and can be handled safely with little danger of slipping out of the hand. It comes with a wooden box and is especially recommended as a gift. It will be appreciated if it is a gift for someone who knows the tea ceremony.

The Festival was started in order to provide a venue where wool producers, wool consumers and wool artisans could come together and share the excitement of working with sheep and their fantastic product \u2013 wool.
