This is best served sooner than later as the avocado color will fade, but it has a few hours of holding power.", "author": "Martha Rose Shulman", "image": [{"@id": "nyt://image/5a62f402-5a58-573d-b0f4-19cec92140b0#videoSixteenByNine1050", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "creditText": "Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times", "dateModified": "2014-04-14T14:36:49.000Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "height": "591", "representativeOfPage": true, "uploadDate": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "width": "1050"}, {"@id": "nyt://image/5a62f402-5a58-573d-b0f4-19cec92140b0#superJumbo", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-superJumbo.jpg", "creditText": "Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times", "dateModified": "2014-04-14T14:36:49.000Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "height": "1365", "representativeOfPage": true, "uploadDate": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-superJumbo.jpg", "width": "2048"}, {"@id": "nyt://image/5a62f402-5a58-573d-b0f4-19cec92140b0#square640", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-square640.jpg", "creditText": "Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times", "dateModified": "2014-04-14T14:36:49.000Z", "datePublished": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "height": "640", "representativeOfPage": true, "uploadDate": "2014-04-14T14:37:01.000Z", "url": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/15/science/14recipehealth/14recipehealth-square640.jpg", "width": "640"}], "totalTime": "PT10M", "recipeYield": "", "recipeCuisine": "indian, mexican", "recipeCategory": "dinner, lunch, quick, appetizer", "keywords": "avocado, cilantro, cumin seed, guacamole, dairy-free, gluten-free, halal, high fiber, low cholesterol, low-fat, low-sodium, low sugar, nut-free, vegan, vegetarian", "aggregateRating": 5, "nutrition": {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NutritionInformation", "calories": 230, "unsaturatedFatContent": "16 grams", "carbohydrateContent": "16 grams", "cholesterolContent": null, "fatContent": "20 grams", "fiberContent": "10 grams", "proteinContent": "3 grams", "saturatedFatContent": "3 grams", "sodiumContent": "169 milligrams", "sugarContent": "2 grams", "transFatContent": "0 grams"}, "recipeIngredient": ["4 ripe Hass avocados, halved and pitted", "1 small tomato, chopped", "1 small red onion, finely diced", "1/2 cup chopped cilantro", "1 jalape\u00f1o, minced (seeded for a milder flavor)", "1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon toasted cumin seeds, ground if desired", "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste", "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground peppercorns", "Juice of 2 limes"], "recipeInstructions": [{"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "HowToStep", "text": "Cut avocados into small dice.

Here Are 5 Easy Substitutes.", "No Cracking Required: Here Are 5 Substitutes for Eggs"], "alternativeHeadline": ["Egg Prices Are (Still) Up. Here Are 5 Easy Substitutes.", "No Cracking Required: Here Are 5 Substitutes for Eggs"], "articleBody": "Let\u2019s be honest: There is no perfect substitute for eggs.\nThat may be why their steady rise in price not only hurts in the budget, but also somewhere in the soul. The crackly, golden wisps around the edges of a fried egg? The golden orb of yolk in a jammy boiled egg? Irreplaceable and often worth the splurge.\nBut when eggs are used as an ingredient, they can, at times, be swapped out, something that\u2019s necessary for those with allergies or other dietary restrictions, and preferable for others.\nTo swap effectively is to understand the many ways eggs work in recipes. For starters, they moisten dishes with their water content and make them richer with their fatty yolks. When the whites are heated or mixed with acid, their proteins coagulate and the whites solidify, adding structure and acting as a glue that binds ingredients. When beaten, whites also trap and hold a lot of air. Yolks and whole eggs can do this, too \u2014 not quite as well as whites alone, but enough that they lift baked goods and add fluffiness to savory dishes.\nBecause cooking and especially baking are made up of a series of chemical reactions, the most foolproof eggless recipes were intentionally created without eggs. But Genevieve Meli, an associate professor of baking and pastry arts at the Culinary Institute of America, thinks most desserts can be made eggless with some trial and error. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d stay away from are confections like nougat,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s pure chemistry.\u201d\nIf you do want to try making an eggy recipe eggless, experiment with the substitutions below, ordered by most to least versatile:\nEgg Substitutes for Baking and Sweets\n1. Flax gel\n\nHow to Sub: For each large egg, which weighs about 50 grams, mix 7 grams (1 tablespoon) flax meal with 43 grams (3 tablespoons) water and let sit until thickened like gel, 5 to 10 minutes.\nWhat It Can Do: Bind ingredients and add structure, moisture and fat.\nWhere to Use It: Cookies, bars, denser cakes, cupcakes, muffins, yeast rolls\nFlax \u201ceggs\u201d are the most versatile substitute because flax contains fat, has a subtle nutty taste that pairs with just about any sweet and binds ingredients together well. Ms. Meli, who recently wrote \u201cBaking an Impact: Small Changes for More Sustainable Baking,\u201d recommends starting with whole flaxseeds and grinding them yourself in a spice grinder because the fat in flax makes preground meal go rancid quickly. She also says that, for most baked goods, whole chia seeds can be used in the same way in the same proportions. Both substitutes would benefit from adding a pinch more of baking powder to the mix.\n2. Aquafaba\n\nHow to Sub: Drain a can of chickpeas in a strainer set over a bowl. That cloudy elixir is aquafaba. It should be as viscous as an egg white; if it isn\u2019t, simmer it to thicken. For one whole egg, use 57 grams (\u00bc cup) and for one egg white, use 29 grams (2 tablespoons).\nWhat It Can Do: Add moisture and, if beaten to peaks, provide lift.\nWhere to Use It: Meringues; Pavlova; sheet cakes; brownies; yeast breads; pancakes\nIt\u2019s a cloudy miracle, the way this bean liquid can be whisked into stiff white peaks that resemble egg whites. It\u2019s stable enough to top a pie (and can even be torched) and to bake into crunchy meringues, but it doesn\u2019t have quite enough structure to hold up a tall cake or keep cookies from crumbling. For desserts that require beaten yolks and whites, like a chiffon cake, Ms. Meli suggests using aquafaba to replace the whites and flax gel for the yolks. Without whipping, aquafaba can be simply stirred into batters or doughs for squat goodies with a larger proportion of other binding ingredients, such as wheat flour or chocolate.\n3. Mashed banana or applesauce\n\nHow to Sub: Smash a very ripe banana until smooth or pur\u00e9e cooked apples (or buy applesauce with apples listed as the only ingredient). For each ingredient, 60 grams (\u00bc cup) should be used in place of each egg.\nWhat It Can Do: Add moisture, bind ingredients and provide some structure.\nWhere to Use It: Drop cookies; muffins; quick breads; pancakes; yeast rolls; carrot cake\nThe natural sweetness of these fruits should be used in treats that pair with their flavors. Banana deepens chocolate, caramel and vanilla, and applesauce enriches anything with warm spices, maple and dried fruit. The two go well with nuts. When swapping these fruits for eggs, Ms. Meli stirs in a little flavorless oil to compensate for lost richness.\nTwo other popular egg substitutes for an airy rise are carbonated water as well as a mixture of baking soda and vinegar, but Ms. Meli considers both options too unpredictable for success.\n______\nEgg Substitutes for Savory Dishes\n4. Tofu\n\nHow to Sub: Buy fresh containers and drain well.\nWhat It Can Do: Resemble creamy eggs; add moisture\nWhere to Use It: Savory egg dishes; creamy sauces\nWhen seasoned with bold flavors and stirred well in a pan, firm tofu tastes pretty close to scrambled eggs. Silken tofu blends into a smooth pur\u00e9e that mimics the creaminess you get from sauces like hollandaise; you can substitute a tablespoon per yolk and add some butter or oil for richness.\n5. Mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, or pumpkin pur\u00e9e\n\nHow to Sub: Make plain, creamy mashed potatoes or buy canned sweet potato or pumpkin pur\u00e9e. Use 60 grams (\u00bc cup) per whole egg.\nWhat It Can Do: Bind ingredients; act as glue\nWhere to Use It: Meatballs; meatloaf; breaded meat\nThese starchy vegetables help ground meat mixtures hold together and crumb coatings cling to chicken cutlets or pork chops destined for pan-frying. Mashed potatoes make the most sense for savory dishes and lend a buttery, creamy flavor. For dishes with warm spices, try sweet potatoes or pumpkin. In all cases, be sure to use a very thin coating for breading meat.\nSome of our favorite eggless recipes for dishes that normally include eggs:\n\nVegan Chocolate Cupcakes | Vegan Brownies With Tahini and Halvah| Peanut-Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies | Strawberry Spoon Cake | Vegan Banana Bread | Breakfast Tofu Scramble | Chicken Miso Meatballs", "articleSection": "Food", "author": "Genevieve Ko", "copyrightHolder": {"@id": "https://www.nytimes.com/#publisher", "@type": "NewsMediaOrganization", "name": "The New York Times"}, "copyrightYear": 2025, "dateModified": "2025-02-10T18:59:07.630Z", "datePublished": "2025-01-13T18:29:06.000Z", "description": "No one ingredient can replace everything an egg can do in a recipe, but these easy replacements come close.", "headline": "How to Substitute Eggs for Baking and Cooking", "image": [{"@id": "nyt://image/f3130062-48d2-532d-96e4-550f5f1831d0#videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600", "@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/11/dining/09Eggs-Shells/merlin_205206762_60e39201-c93e-41c4-996d-d1d4eb8ca2aa-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "creditText": "Sang An for The New York Times.
